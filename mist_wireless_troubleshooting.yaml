    Automated workflow for troubleshooting wireless client connectivity using Mist systems.
    The automated script checks key logs and client health metrics; all further troubleshooting is manual.

  automated_script_scope:
    input:
      - client_ip
      - client_mac
    checks:
      - authentication_authorization_failure_logs
      - dns_dhcp_lease_errors
      - client_health_metrics:
          - rssi
          - snr
          - retries
          - latency
    output_logic:
      - condition: authentication_authorization_failure_logs_detected
        output: "Due to detected authentication/authorization failures, troubleshoot on ISE."
      - condition: dns_dhcp_lease_errors_detected
        output: "Due to detected DNS/DHCP lease errors, check network infrastructure (LAN, WAN, DHCP, DNS)."
      - condition: client_health_metrics_issues_detected
        output: "Client health metric issue detected; refer to manual troubleshooting workflow."
      - condition: no_issues_detected
        output: "All automated checks look good; proceed with manual troubleshooting steps as needed."

  manual_troubleshooting_actions:
    steps:
      - if_auth_failure_troubleshoot_on: ISE
      - if_dns_dhcp_errors_check: [LAN, WAN, DHCP, DNS]
      - client_connectivity_analysis: [reachability, latency, drops]
      - assess_ap_radio_performance: [client_load, channel_utilization, noise]
      - ap_hardware_checks: [led_status, physical_integrity, cabling]
      - rf_environment_analysis: [coverage, interference, spectrum_validation]
